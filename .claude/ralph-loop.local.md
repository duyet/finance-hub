## Recently Completed

### Household Sharing (Iteration 189)
- **Multi-user households** with role-based permissions (owner/admin/member/viewer)
- **Invite flow**: Token-based invites with 72h expiration, email acceptance
- **Data isolation**: Transactions/accounts owned by creator, household grants access
- **Service**: createHousehold(), acceptInvite(), leaveHousehold(), removeMember()
- **UI**: HouseholdSummaryCard, HouseholdMembersCard, HouseholdInvitesCard
- **Route**: `/settings/household`
- **Cloudflare Workers migration**: wrangler.toml with [assets] binding, app/entry.server.tsx

### Correlations Analysis (Iteration 188)
- **Pearson correlation** coefficient for category relationships: r = Σ((x-μₓ)(y-μᵧ)) / √(Σ(x-μₓ)² × Σ(y-μᵧ)²)
- **Significance testing**: t-statistic with p-value approximation
- **Timing patterns**: Day-of-week, monthly, seasonal analysis
- **Income-spending coupling**: Lifestyle inflation detection
- **UI**: CorrelationInsightsCard, CorrelationMatrixCard (heatmap), TimingPatternsCard
- **Route**: `/settings/correlations`

### Smart Categorization (Iteration 187)
- **Pattern matching**: contains, equals, regex, fuzzy (Levenshtein distance)
- **Historical learning**: Auto-create patterns from 3+ similar transactions
- **80% confidence threshold** for auto-categorization
- **Route**: `/settings/smart-categorization`

### Anomaly Detection (Iteration 185)
- **Z-score analysis**: |Z| > 2.5 indicates outliers
- **30-day rolling baselines** by category
- **Severity levels**: critical (80+), high (60-79), medium (40-59), low (<40)
- **Route**: `/settings/anomaly-detection`

## Philosophy

**Self-working, self-documenting, self-improving autonomous system.**

Plan → Implement → Test → Deploy → Monitor → Repeat

- Pick tasks from @TODO.md by priority/impact
- Keep CLAUDE.md and README.md current
- Focus: core functions, UX, reliability > fancy features
- Self-deploy each iteration, verify live
- Mobile-first, performance-first, security-first

⚠️ **Never commit secrets, API tokens, or sensitive data.**
